                        <h3>About The Democratic Republic of Congo</h3>
                        <p>The Democratic Republic of Congo (DR Congo) is a nation renowned for its rich and vibrant cultural heritage, which reflects a tapestry of diverse ethnic groups and traditions. From its dynamic music and dances to its intricate art and delectable cuisine, the DR Congo offers a cuktural wealth that significantly contributes to global artistic and cultural landscapes. The country's influence extends beyond its borders, with its vast natural resources and pivotal role in regional and international affairs. On June 30th, the DR Congo celebrates their Independence Day, commemorating its liberation from Belgian colonial rule in 1960, a milestone that marks its journey towards self-determination and national identity.</p>
                        <blockquote>
                            “History will one day have its say, but it will not be the history that Brussels, Paris, Washington or the United Nations will teach, but that which they will teach in the countries emancipated from colonialism and its puppets. Africa will write its own history, and it will be, to the north and to the south of the Sahara, a history of glory and dignity.”
                            <cite>Patrice Emery Lumbumba, 1960</cite>
                        </blockquote>
                        <h3>Why #FreeCongo?</h3>
                        <p>The Democratic Republic of Congo is currently enduring a profound crisis characterised by relentless violence, political instability and severe humanitarian issues. Armed conflicts between rebel groups and government forces have led to widespread atrocities, including the exploitation and abuse, in all ways, of the Congolese people. Many are forced to work under brutal conditions in the country's mining sector,being met with indescribable punishment and violence, which is rife with human rights abuses. The situation is compounded by economic hardship, inadequate infrastructure and limited access to essential services, creating a severe and complex humanitarian emergency that demands urgent and comprehensive international responses.</p>
                        <p>The #FreeCongo movement emerged in response to these egregious conditions, aiming to raise awareness and drive action to address the humanitarian crisis and promote human rights. This movement highlights the plight of the Congolese people, calls for an end to the exploitation and violence, and advocates for international support to resolve the crisis. By mobilising global solidarity and urging systemic change, #FreeCongo seeks to amplify the voices of those affected and pressure both national and international actors to take meaningful steps toward justice and reform in DR Congo.</p>
